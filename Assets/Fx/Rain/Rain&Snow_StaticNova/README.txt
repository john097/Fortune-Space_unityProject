Thanks for purchasing Snow & Rain Particle Prefab!

To import the package into your Unity 3D project (Skip this if you purchased & imported via the Unity Asset Store):

• Double Click the included .unitypackage file, then click the 'import' button making sure all files are selected.
— or —
• Assets > Import Package > select the included .unitypackage file > Open > then click on the 'import'
button making sure all files are selected.

Adding the prefabs to your scene:

• The prefabs will be located in Rain&Snow_StaticNova > Prefabs > Legacy or Shuriken. Simply select which weather effect you'd like and drag it into your scene hierarchy. There are four options, in both legacy & shuriken, select the one you want and drag it in!
Note: If using Rain_WithSplash_Legacy_Prefab or Snow_WithSplash_Legacy_Prefab, ensure that the splash is linked under SplashScript_legacy in the inspector (This isn't required for Shuriken).


• Values of the praticle systems are tweakable via the relevant prefab, however it is not reccomended increasing the particle count any further for performance reasons.
